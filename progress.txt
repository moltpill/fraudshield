## Phase 1: Foundation


## STORY-001: Initialize monorepo with pnpm workspaces ✅
- Created pnpm-workspace.yaml
- Created root package.json with workspace scripts
- Created tsconfig.json with @fraudshield/* path aliases
- Created package.json for all 5 packages (shared, sdk, api, dashboard, admin)
- Added .gitignore
- All 8 tests passing
- Committed: f02724d

### STORY-001: Initialize monorepo with pnpm workspaces ✅
- pnpm workspaces auto-create symlinks in packages/*/node_modules — added to .gitignore


### STORY-002: Setup shared types package ✅
- Created Tier enum (FREE, STARTER, GROWTH, SCALE, ENTERPRISE)
- Created Account type with id, email, name, tier, status, createdAt
- Created ApiKey type with id, accountId, key, name, status, allowedDomains, createdAt
- Created Visitor type with id, fingerprint, firstSeen, lastSeen, visits
- Created VisitorEvent type with id, visitorId, apiKeyId, signals, risk, timestamp
- Created UsageRecord type with id, accountId, date, count
- All types exported from index.ts
- 6 tests passing
- Committed: 1f742a0

**Learning:** Root tsconfig has `noEmit: true` for type-checking only; packages needing build output must override with `noEmit: false`

### STORY-002: Setup shared types package ✅
- Created Account, ApiKey, Visitor, VisitorEvent, UsageRecord, Tier types
- Root tsconfig has noEmit: true; packages needing build must override with noEmit: false


### STORY-003: Setup Prisma schema for accounts and API keys ✅
- Created prisma/schema.prisma with Account and ApiKey models
- SQLite datasource for development (DATABASE_URL env var)
- Account fields: id, email (unique), name, tier, status, createdAt
- ApiKey fields: id, accountId, key (unique), name, status, allowedDomains (JSON string), createdAt
- Relation: Account has many ApiKeys with cascade delete
- Added db:generate, db:push, db:studio scripts to package.json
- 6 tests passing (create, relations, unique constraints, tier values)
- Committed: f01c5c9

**Learning:** SQLite doesn't support enums — use String fields with application-level validation instead. Prisma 7 has breaking changes (config file required); Prisma 5 is more stable for quick setup.

### STORY-003: Setup Prisma schema for accounts and API keys ✅
- SQLite doesn't support enums — use String fields with app-level validation
- Prisma 5 is stable; Prisma 7 has breaking changes
- allowedDomains stored as JSON string (parse at app level)



### STORY-004: Setup Prisma schema for visitors and events ✅
- Created Visitor model with fingerprint (unique), firstSeen, lastSeen, visitCount
- Created VisitorEvent model with signals (JSON string), riskScore, detection flags (isBot, isVpn, isTor, isDatacenter)
- Index on Visitor.fingerprint for fast lookup
- Index on VisitorEvent.timestamp for time-based queries
- Index on VisitorEvent.visitorId and apiKeyId for relation lookups
- Relations: VisitorEvent → Visitor (cascade delete), VisitorEvent → ApiKey (cascade delete)
- Added visitorEvents relation to ApiKey model
- 8 tests covering creation, constraints, relations, and index usage
- Committed: 225fa17

**Learning:** Prisma needs to run from the package directory containing the schema, or use pnpm workspace scripts

### STORY-004: Setup Prisma schema for visitors and events ✅
- Visitor: fingerprint (unique+indexed), firstSeen, lastSeen, visitCount
- VisitorEvent: signals JSON, riskScore, detection flags (isBot, isVpn, isTor, isDatacenter)
- Prisma must run from package directory containing schema (not project root)



### STORY-005: Setup Prisma schema for usage tracking ✅
- Created UsageRecord model with accountId, date, requestCount
- Unique constraint on accountId + date (for atomic daily tracking)
- Created TierLimit model with tier (unique), monthlyLimit, features JSON
- Seed script populates all 5 tiers: FREE (1K), STARTER (10K), GROWTH (100K), SCALE (1M), ENTERPRISE (unlimited)
- Added usageRecords relation to Account model
- Fixed test isolation in all test files (beforeEach cleanup)
- 36 tests passing
- Committed: ecdcd1a

**Learning:** Test isolation is critical — always add beforeEach cleanup when tests create related data. Adding new relations requires updating cleanup order in existing test files.

### STORY-005: Setup Prisma schema for usage tracking ✅
- UsageRecord: accountId + date unique constraint, requestCount with default 0
- TierLimit: tier (unique), monthlyLimit, features JSON
- Seed via `pnpm db:seed` or `prisma db seed`
- Test isolation requires cleaning child tables before parents

### STORY-005: Setup Prisma schema for usage tracking ✅
- UsageRecord: accountId + date unique constraint for daily tracking
- TierLimit: tier limits and features JSON, seeded for all 5 tiers
- Test isolation critical — always add beforeEach cleanup when tests create related data
